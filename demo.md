### Pattern 1: 1D Dynamic Programming

1D Dynamic Programming is often the starting point for beginners. Here, you deal with problems where the solution can be represented as a linear progression, often involving sequences or simple state transitions.

- **Climbing Stairs**: A classic problem that demonstrates how each step depends on the previous one or two steps.

- **Frog Jump**: Similar to climbing stairs but with varying jump lengths.

- **Frog Jump with K**: Extends the basic Frog Jump problem to allow jumps of up to K steps.

- **Maximum Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements**: Find the maximum sum possible by selecting elements that are not adjacent in an array.  
  - URL: [House Robber (LeetCode)](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

- **House Robber**: A variant of the above problem where you're a robber trying to maximize your loot without robbing two adjacent houses.

- **Ninja's Training 2**: A more complex problem where each action affects future decisions.

**Key Takeaway**: These problems teach you to think in terms of cumulative solutions, where the current state is determined by previous decisions.
